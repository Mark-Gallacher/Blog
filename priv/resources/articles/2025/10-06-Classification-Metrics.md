  description: "Knowing what model is use, how to configure the model and
evaluating the model are all dependant on the choice of metric. If our data is
not equally balanced across all of our groups, models will tend to perform
better with the larger classes. The weaker performance with the smaller classes
can go unnoticed, if an improper metric is used to evaluate the model. This
issue is particularly problematic when we are training on medical data.", show:
